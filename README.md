A set of Jupyter Notebooks for learning various quantum programming platforms

It is meant for the 'already-initiated' - someone who already knows the basics of quantum programming in one platform and wants to compare, migrate or explore the features of another platform.

Most of the materials are derived from various other official or community tutorials of the respective platforms; packaged as a cheatsheet to get one started in a fast paced learning speed. More advanced features are provided as links for exploring in a need-to-know basis.
